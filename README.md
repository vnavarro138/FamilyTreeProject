# FamilyTreeProject

This project is an aesthetically pleasing dynamic family tree website, that offers more personalized family information than any other ancestry website out there.
We pull information input by the user from firebase, and then display this information on the webpage in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
The main page shows the family tree, and when you click on a specific family member you will be sent to another page that gets populated with their fun facts. 
Moment.js is used to grab the person's birth year from the date of birth entered into the database, youtube API grabs a music video for the person's favorite song to be embedded into the page, IMDB API displays the movie poster for the person's favorite movie along with the movie information into a table.
AJAX is used to pull data for multiple APIs, wiki API is used to display headlines from the year the person was born, Flickr API is used to retrieve and display popular images for both the occupation and hobbies for the individual family member, Bootstrap is utilized to make the page responsive. 
To use this API, you have to select a member of our group to add a family member to. Then fill out the form with the appropriate family member information. Refresh the main page, and then click on the family member you want to see details for. Now sit back and admire the family member's cool individual webpage.
